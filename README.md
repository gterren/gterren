- Hi, my name is Guillermo. I'm a Postdoc at the Environmental Studies Program and the Environmental Markets Lab (emLab) at UC Santa Barbara.
- I’m interested in probabilistic machine learning, deep learning, Bayesian statistics, computer vision, and optimization for renewable energy integration and smart grid applications.
- I’m currently learning functional data analysis and optimization for operational planning of modern grids with high participation of renewable energy sources
- I’m looking to collaborate on solar, wind, and demand forecasts using remote sensing (sky imagers, satellite imagery) and numerical weather prediction.
- Feel free to reach me at guille.terren@gmail.com
