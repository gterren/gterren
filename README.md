- Hi, my name is Guillermo. I'm a Postdoc at the Environmental Studies Program and the Environmental Markets Lab (emLab) at UC Santa Barbara.
- I’m interested in machine learning, Bayesian statistics, remote sensing, and operational research for renewable energy integration.
- I’m currently learning functional data analysis and optimization for operational planning of modern grids with high participation of renewable energy sources
- I’m looking to collaborate on day-ahead, intra-day, and intra-hour solar and wind generation, and electricity demand forecasts using remote sensing (sky imagers, satellite imagery) and numerical weather prediction models.
